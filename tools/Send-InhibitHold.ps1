.SYNOPSIS
  Minimal TX Inhibit KEY-agent stand-in for Windows. Needs no keyboard focus.

.DESCRIPTION
  Sends the UDP hold protocol from docs/TX_INHIBIT.md so TX Inhibit can be
  exercised while you are driving the WSJT-X window with mouse and keyboard.

  The interactive helper (inhibit-test) reads a held key and therefore
  needs focus itself, which makes it impossible to hold the KEY and
  press Tune in WSJT-X at the same time. This script holds from a
  separate window instead, leaving WSJT-X free.

  Mirrors the Hold-sender half of a real KEY agent (docs/TX_INHIBIT.md 3):
  an immediate hold, keepalives about every 200 ms, and an explicit release
  (ttl_ms 0) on exit.

  Fail-safe: if this script is killed without releasing, the station's own hold
  timeout clears the hold after -TtlMs (default 600 ms). That is the deadman
  path, and it is the reason keepalives exist.

.EXAMPLE
  # Hold until Ctrl+C. Start this, then go press Tune in WSJT-X.
  .\Send-InhibitHold.ps1

.EXAMPLE
  # Hold for 20 seconds, then release automatically.
  .\Send-InhibitHold.ps1 -Seconds 20

.EXAMPLE
  # Clear a stuck hold.
  .\Send-InhibitHold.ps1 -Release

.NOTES
  -TargetHost, not -Host: $Host is a reserved PowerShell automatic variable.
